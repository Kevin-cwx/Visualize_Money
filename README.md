# Money Visualizer

This is a web tool that takes a monetary value and breaks it down into individual bills or coins, depending on the selected currency. It updates visually and interactively, making it easy to understand how that amount is made up using real-world denominations.

## How to Use

1.  Enter a monetary value in the input field.
2.  Use the toggle switch to select between FL and XCG currencies.
3.  Observe the dynamic visual representation of the money.
4.  Click the dice button to randomize the bill and coin breakdown.
